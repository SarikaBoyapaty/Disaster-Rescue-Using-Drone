# Human-Detection-Using-Drone

This project focuses on detecting humans in disaster scenarios using three different methods. The system is designed to send a message to a predefined number whenever a human is detected. The detection methods include:

Live Camera Feed: Utilizes the laptop's live camera to detect humans in real-time.
AI-Generated Dataset: Employs a custom dataset simulating people trapped in earthquake scenarios to train AI models for human detection.
Drone Footage: Analyzes video recorded by a DJI Naza M Lite drone to identify humans in the footage.
We used Vonage for sending messages and Visual Studio for project development. The objective of this project is to enhance disaster response times by promptly alerting rescuers to the presence of humans in disaster-stricken areas.

In each scenario, the software sends an alert message to a predefined number upon detecting a human, ensuring a faster response in disaster situations.
